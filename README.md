Data mining in the educational sector is crucial for predicting students’ ways. Association rules in data mining are suitable for analysing and predicting student behaviour, thereby generating rules based on discovered patterns.
In this project, a large amount of data is gathered in educational institutions about students’ attendance, CGPA, Exeat record, courses, administrative, etc.
The interesting patterns discovered have a huge potential for screening the exeat applications of students based on the relationships found by the intelligent system and ultimately helping management in decision-making with respect to exeat applications.
In this project, Microsoft Excel was used for storing the gathered data, which was converted into a csv file.
Python programming language was used in implementing the Frequent Pattern-Growth algorithm, which involves the construction of the Frequent Pattern-tree and the extraction of frequent item sets.
The results obtained by the implemented algorithm proved that association rules are suitable for analysing interesting patterns in students' exeat data.
